He was studying the properties of gases and discovered that shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more than longer (red) wavelengths by tiny particles in the atmosphere.\\n\\nHere's how it works:\\n\\n1. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\\n2. The shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more efficiently by these gas molecules because they have a larger cross-sectional area relative to their size.

The longer red and orange wavelengths, on the other hand, are not scattered as much because they have a smaller cross-sectional area. They travel in more direct paths to our eyes, reaching us mainly from the direction of the sun.\\n4. Since we see the combined effect of all these scattered blue photons and unscattered red photons, the sky appears blue during the daytime when the sun is overhead.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the exact shade of blue can vary depending on several factors, such as:\\n\\n* Atmospheric conditions: Dust, pollution, and water vapor can scatter light in different ways, changing the apparent color of the sky.\\n* Time of day: As the sun moves lower in the sky, the scattering effect is reduced, and the sky may appear more orange or red due to the increased dominance of longer wavelengths.\\n* Altitude and atmospheric pressure: Higher altitudes and lower pressures can affect the scattering of light, making the sky appear more intense blue.\\n\\nSo, there you have it!
